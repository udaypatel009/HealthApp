## 30 Days of Kotlin

This app is the result of my learning during the [30 Days of Kotlin program](https://eventsonair.withgoogle.com/events/kotlin#) by Google Devs India. I've switched from beginner to intermediate level in Kotlin while learning from this program.

Highlights of concepts and technologies used in this app:
- Android KTX
- Nullable data types
- Material Design Components
- Lottie animation
- ViewModel
- LiveData
- DataBinding
